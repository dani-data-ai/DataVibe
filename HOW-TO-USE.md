## Best Practices & Tips

### üîí Security Best Practices
1. **Use Read-Only Credentials**: For production databases, use read-only database users
2. **Review Generated SQL**: Always check SQL before execution
3. **Test in Development**: Try schema changes in dev environment first
4. **Monitor Audit Logs**: Regularly review system activity

### üéØ Query Writing Tips
1. **Be Specific**: "Show customers from Germany" vs "Show customers"
2. **Use Table Names**: "Show orders from the orders table"
3. **Specify Time Ranges**: "Orders from last month" vs "recent orders"
4. **Include Limits**: "Top 10 products" instead of "best products"

### üìä Result Management
1. **Use Filters**: Filter large result sets for better performance
2. **Export Data**: Download results for further analysis
3. **Save Queries**: Note successful query patterns for reuse

### üèóÔ∏è Schema Management
1. **Plan Changes**: Think through schema modifications carefully
2. **Use Descriptive Names**: Clear column and table names
3. **Test Thoroughly**: Validate changes in development first
4. **Document Changes**: Provide clear descriptions in proposals
