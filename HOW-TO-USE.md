## Best Practices & Tips

### üîí Security Best Practices
1. **Use Read-Only Credentials**: For production databases, use read-only database users
2. **Review Generated SQL**: Always check SQL before execution
3. **Test in Development**: Try schema changes in dev environment first
4. **Monitor Audit Logs**: Regularly review system activity

### üéØ Query Writing Tips
1. **Be Specific**: "Show customers from Germany" vs "Show customers"
2. **Use Table Names**: "Show orders from the orders table"
3. **Specify Time Ranges**: "Orders from last month" vs "recent orders"
4. **Include Limits**: "Top 10 products" instead of "best products"

### üìä Result Management
1. **Use Filters**: Filter large result sets for better performance
2. **Export Data**: Download results for further analysis
3. **Save Queries**: Note successful query patterns for reuse

### üèóÔ∏è Schema Management
1. **Plan Changes**: Think through schema modifications carefully
2. **Use Descriptive Names**: Clear column and table names
3. **Test Thoroughly**: Validate changes in development first
4. **Document Changes**: Provide clear descriptions in proposals

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues

**Problem**: "Connection failed" error
**Solutions**:
1. **Check Connection String Format**: Ensure your connection string matches the provider format exactly
2. **Verify Credentials**: Double-check username, password, host, and database name
3. **Test Provider Access**: Try connecting from the provider's web interface first
4. **Check SSL Requirements**: Most cloud providers require SSL connections
5. **Firewall/Network**: Ensure your network allows outbound connections to the database host

**Problem**: Supabase Connection Issues
**Common Solutions**:
1. **Use the correct format**: `postgresql://postgres:your-password@db.your-project.supabase.co:5432/postgres`
2. **Check project settings**: Go to Supabase ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Database for connection details
3. **Verify password**: Reset database password if needed in Supabase dashboard
4. **Enable SSL**: Supabase requires SSL connections - this is handled automatically
5. **Check IP restrictions**: Ensure your IP is allowed (Supabase free tier allows all IPs by default)

**Problem**: "Database not found" error
**Solutions**:
1. For Supabase: Use `postgres` as database name (default)
2. For Neon: Use the database name from your Neon dashboard
3. For PlanetScale: Use the database name from your PlanetScale dashboard
4. Check the exact database name in your provider's console

**Problem**: "Authentication failed" error
**Solutions**:
1. **Reset Password**: Use your provider's dashboard to reset the database password
2. **Check Username**: 
   - Supabase: Usually `postgres`
   - Neon: Your chosen username
   - PlanetScale: Your created username
3. **Special Characters**: If password contains special characters, ensure they're URL-encoded
4. **Copy-Paste**: Copy connection string directly from provider to avoid typos

**Problem**: "Connection timeout" error
**Solutions**:
1. **Network Issues**: Check your internet connection
2. **Provider Status**: Check if your database provider is experiencing outages
3. **Database Sleep**: Some free-tier databases sleep after inactivity - wake them up first
4. **Retry**: Sometimes temporary network issues resolve themselves

**Step-by-Step Supabase Troubleshooting**:
1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to Settings ‚Üí Database
3. Copy the connection string under "Connection string"
4. Replace `[YOUR-PASSWORD]` with your actual database password
5. If you don't know the password, reset it: Settings ‚Üí Database ‚Üí Reset database password
6. Test the connection string in DataVibe

**Example Working Connection Strings**:

**Supabase**:
```
postgresql://postgres:your_actual_password@db.abcdefghijklmnop.supabase.co:5432/postgres
```

**Neon**:
```
postgresql://username:password@ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/neondb
```

**PlanetScale**:
```
mysql://username:pscale_pw_XXXXXX@aws.connect.psdb.cloud/database-name?sslaccept=strict
```

### Query Issues

**Problem**: "No SQL generated" or low confidence
**Solutions**:
1. Be more specific in your query description
2. Include table names in your question
3. Try using query templates as starting points
4. Check that your database schema is accessible

**Problem**: Query returns no results
**Solutions**:
1. Verify data exists in the tables
2. Check filter conditions in the generated SQL
3. Try a simpler query first
4. Review table structure and data types

### Schema Management Issues

**Problem**: Schema proposal rejected
**Solutions**:
1. Review the rejection reason provided
2. Modify your proposal based on feedback
3. Test the change in development environment first
4. Consult with your database administrator

### Authentication Issues

**Problem**: Can't sign in
**Solutions**:
1. Check email and password
2. Use password reset if needed
3. Clear browser cache and cookies
4. Try a different browser

**Problem**: Email verification not received
**Solutions**:
1. Check spam/junk folder
2. Wait a few minutes and try again
3. Ensure email address is correct
4. Contact support if issues persist
