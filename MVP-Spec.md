# Lovable AI for Databases — MVP Specification



## 1. Project Overview


Design and Development logic: 

## BOTA (Brain of the Architects ) that will do brainstorming sessions

**Description:**  
BOTA is the collective design intelligence and guidance system for the project. Its role is to facilitate brainstorming, architectural decisions, and ensure all critical perspectives are considered at each major step. After each milestone, BOTA convenes to recommend and prioritize next steps.

**Roles in BOTA:**

- **PO — Product Owner:** Defines business needs, priorities, and success criteria.
- **UX — User Experience Architect:** Ensures usability, accessibility, and delightful user interactions.
- **LLM Architect:** Designs overall AI/LLM system integration, safety, and architectural fit.
- **LLM Senior Engineer:** Implements, optimizes, and maintains LLM-based features and prompt engineering.
- **DBA — Database Architect:** Guides database structure, connections, migrations, and data safety.
- **SWA — Software Architect:** Owns system architecture, stack choices, and technical direction.
- **Senior Tester:** Designs and executes testing strategies for quality and reliability.
- **SA — Security Architect:** Oversees security design, threat modeling, and compliance.
- **NA — Networking Architect:** Ensures robust, scalable, and secure networking/connectivity.

**BOTA Brainstorming Action:**  
After each completed milestone (e.g., project scaffold), BOTA holds a brainstorming “roundtable.” Each role briefly states their recommended next step(s) based on the latest project state and MVP-Spec.md.  
The Software Architect (SWA) synthesizes these recommendations and makes the final decision for the next development step.


**Summary:**  
Lovable AI for Databases is a web application that enables users to manage and query relational databases using natural language prompts, powered by large language models (LLMs). The application focuses on making database exploration, querying, and simple schema modifications accessible, safe, and transparent.

**Target Users:**  
- Data analysts
- Developers
- Business users with basic data literacy
- Database administrators (for review/approval workflows)

**Key Goals:**
- Allow users to connect to existing databases (e.g., Northwind, public data warehouse) and interact using plain language.
- Enable safe data exploration and querying in production (read-only).
- Allow simple schema changes (e.g., add column, create view) in a controlled development environment.
- Integrate LLMs to interpret prompts, generate and explain SQL, and ensure user confirmation before executing operations.
- Maintain clear separation between development and production environments, with PR-style approval workflow for schema changes.
- Provide a modern web interface that abstracts away direct SQL interaction, focusing on usability and security.

## 2. Core User Stories & Flows

### User Story 1: Connect to an Existing Database
- **As a** user
- **I want to** connect the app to an existing relational database (e.g., Northwind, Postgres, MySQL)
- **So that** I can explore and query data using natural language

**Basic Flow:**
1. User opens the app and is prompted to enter database connection details (host, port, database, username, password).
2. App validates the connection and saves it securely for the session.
3. User receives confirmation of a successful connection or a clear error message with troubleshooting tips.

---

### User Story 2: Natural Language Data Exploration (Read-Only)
- **As a** user
- **I want to** ask questions or request data (e.g., "Show me all customers from Germany") using plain English
- **So that** I can retrieve and explore data without writing SQL

**Basic Flow:**
1. User types a question or request in the prompt bar.
2. App uses LLM to generate SQL and display a preview/summary of the query.
3. User reviews, edits if needed, and confirms execution.
4. App runs the query in read-only mode and displays results in a table with explanations.

---

### User Story 3: Transparent SQL Generation & Safety
- **As a** user
- **I want to** see the generated SQL and have the ability to modify it
- **So that** I understand exactly what will be executed and can ensure safety

**Basic Flow:**
1. After asking a question, the app shows the SQL statement it intends to run.
2. User can edit the SQL or accept as-is.
3. App displays warnings for potentially unsafe operations (e.g., large result sets, complex joins).

---

### User Story 4: Simple Schema Changes in Development
- **As a** developer or DBA (in a dev environment)
- **I want to** request simple schema changes (e.g., "Add a column to the customers table")
- **So that** I can prototype changes with LLM assistance

**Basic Flow:**
1. User makes a schema change request using natural language.
2. App generates the SQL migration and shows a preview.
3. User reviews and approves the migration.
4. App applies the change in a development environment and logs the operation.

---

### User Story 5: Production Safety & Approval Workflow
- **As a** DBA or admin
- **I want to** prevent direct schema changes in production and require approval (e.g., PR-style workflow)
- **So that** production data remains safe and all changes are auditable

**Basic Flow:**
1. User attempts a schema change in production.
2. App blocks direct changes and creates a migration proposal (pull request or approval ticket).
3. Admin reviews, approves, and merges the change.
4. App applies the approved migration and logs the update.

---

### User Story 6: Explain Results and Guide Users
- **As a** user
- **I want to** receive clear explanations of query results and suggestions for follow-up questions
- **So that** I can learn and make better use of my data

**Basic Flow:**
1. After executing a query, the app summarizes the results and offers context (e.g., "There are 12 customers from Germany").
2. App suggests related questions or next steps (e.g., "Would you like to see their orders?").

## 3. Technical Architecture Overview

**Frontend:**
- Modern web app (React, Next.js, or similar)
- Secure authentication (with optional OAuth support)
- Responsive design for desktop and tablet use
- Communicates with backend via REST or GraphQL API

**Backend:**
- Language: Python (FastAPI), Node.js (Express), or similar
- API endpoints for:
  - Database connection management
  - Natural language prompt handling
  - Query execution and result streaming
  - Schema change proposals and migration
- Integrates with LLM API (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic Claude) for prompt-to-SQL translation and explanations
- Implements safety checks and query validation
- Logs all queries and schema change proposals for auditability

**Database:**
- Supports major relational databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL)
- Uses connection pooling and secure credential storage
- Read-only mode enforced for production connections
- Separate development and production environments

**LLM Integration:**
- Abstracts LLM calls in a service layer for prompt-to-SQL translation, SQL explanation, and result summarization
- Ensures prompt context includes user role, database schema, and safety guardrails

**DevOps & Deployment:**
- Containerized with Docker
- Local development via Docker Compose (app + db)
- Option for deployment to cloud (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP) or Vercel for frontend
- Environment variable management for secrets and config

- No real-time sync or notifications
- No mobile-first design (focus on desktop/tablet)

---

## 6. Risks & Mitigations

- **Risk:** LLM generates unsafe or incorrect SQL  
  **Mitigation:** Always require user review; add query validation and safety checks

- **Risk:** Accidental schema changes in production  
  **Mitigation:** Enforce PR-style workflow; restrict to admin users

- **Risk:** User confusion about environments  
  **Mitigation:** Clear UI indicators for prod vs. dev; require confirmation for sensitive actions

- **Risk:** Credential or data leaks  
  **Mitigation:** Use secure credential storage; never expose secrets in logs or UI

---

## 7. Success Criteria & MVP Completion

- Users can connect to at least one sample database and run read-only natural language queries
- LLM reliably generates and explains SQL from prompts
- Users can preview, approve, and execute safe queries
- Schema changes can be proposed and applied in dev, with PR-style workflow for production
- Full audit trail/log of all operations
- MVP is containerized, runs locally via Docker Compose, and can be deployed to a basic cloud environment
